    <h1>Privacy Policy for Suvenir</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 04/12/2024 (dd/mm/aaaa)</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Suvenir is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use our application. 
        Our app operates entirely locally on your device and does not collect, share, or transmit any personal data to external servers or third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Our application accesses and processes images and media files stored on your device. This is done solely to provide the app's core functionality, such as managing and organizing your media files.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access to Storage:</strong> The app requests permissions to read and write to your device's storage. This access is necessary to:
            <ul>
                <li>Allow you to view and manage your images.</li>
                <li>Save modifications or changes made to your media files.</li>
                <li>Enable features such as moving images between folders or deleting them upon your request.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>At no point is your data uploaded to external servers, nor is it shared with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Local Processing</h2>
    <p>
        All operations within Suvenir occur locally on your device. This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your images and files never leave your device.</li>
        <li>No data is transmitted or stored outside of your device.</li>
        <li>We do not collect analytics or usage data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        To provide its functionality, the app requires the following permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read External Storage:</strong> To access and display the images and files stored on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Write External Storage:</strong> To modify, move, or delete media files upon your request.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used exclusively for the app's core features and nothing else.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Suvenir does not use third-party services or integrations that process, collect, or transmit your data.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since Suvenir does not collect or store any of your personal data, there is no data to delete, export, or share. 
        You retain full control over your media files and device storage.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the app and will include an updated "Effective Date."
